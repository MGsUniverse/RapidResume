# RapidResume
## How to Setup
- Open the .env file and place your OpenAI API key where it says "YOUR_API_KEY"
- If you do not have a web server like Apache installed (I recommend xampp, as it makes it very easy to use Apache) install one
- Place all the files in a directory called "__rapidresume__", and place the directory in the webserver's directory for webpages (for xampp, it is htdocs)
- Run the index.js file in the root of the repository by using node.js and running "__node index.js__"
- Open up your webserver and run it
- Go to a browser of your choice and enter "__localhost/rapidresume__"
## How to Use
- Select whether you want the output to be in Markdown or Plain Text (PDF) format. You can find these options on the left-hand side of the screen.
- Drag-and-drop your PDF, DOC, or DOCX file on the box on the right-hand side, or click the "__Upload File__" button in the box.
- Click the "__Start__" button
- Wait for the resume to be processed. Do not worry if it looks to be not doing anything, as the process can take a few minutes.
- You will be presented with a preview page. At the bottom there will be 2 buttons. One of them says Re-submit. If you do not like how the resume turned out, click that button and it will be processed again.
- Click the "__Download__" button beneath the "__Re-submit__" button. This will either download a .md file (if you chode Markdown) or a PDF (if you chose Plain Text).
- You will be taken to a Thank You page. If you wish to be taken back to the main page, click the "__Return to Main Page__" button.
